# all_widgets_flutter

This project gives the easy understanding of how to build the UI Widgets

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Gives the simple demonstration of some basic widgets. 
There are of 2 types of widgets 

 - Single Child Widgets :  <br />
       - Centre (Can make the widget to it centre) <br/>
       - Align (Can align using the graphical representation) <br />
       - Container (Can Maintain the position)<br/>
       - Padding (Can set Padding for respective sides)<br/>
       - SizedBOx (Can give the respective width and height for its child widget)<br/><br/>
       
 - Multi Child Widget :
       - Column (All the views are arranded vertical)<br/>
       - Row (All the views are arranded horizontal)<br/>
       - Stack (Keep the view one over the another like frame layout in android)<br/>
       - GridView (Keps the items in grid by specifing the count and either start || reverse)<br/>
       - ListView (Bind all the items in the list. Here we can also make customised listview or by default listview item widgets)<br/>
       - ScrollView (There is no scrollview in flutter make use of listview..)<br/><br/>
       
  -UI Design Tips:<br/>
      - For making the space between the 2 widgets use sizedBox<br/>
        eg:<br/>
        SizedBox(height: 10)<br/>
      - Here all the view are basically a widgets<br/>
      - Stateless Widget - once initialised can be chanbged<br/>
      - Statefull Widget - Can be changed many times by calling the 'setState()' method<br/>
      - Pubspec.yaml file - Place Were all dependencies to be added - fonts, assets, images<br/>
      - Expanded widget - Will fill the available spaces <br/>
      - Each screen is called as Route<br/>
      - Were all the navigations can be handled through Navigator<br/>
      - Push and pop is used to navigate and popback to previous Route<br/>
      - Decoration : is used to set background colors and shape<br/>
      - Flutter is space Specific<br/>
      - Easy to set images from assets, url, etc..
      - Class will have of the AppBar (title,icon) and body
      - Scafold class gives the support for the Material design
